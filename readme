To properly setup the device, the following steps are needed:

1. Activate i2c interface for rasperrypi
-> sudo raspy-config
-> Interface Options -> I2c enable

2. install i2c-tools and detect address of device
sudo apt-get install i2c-tools
i2cdetect -y 1

--> adress can be seen in output. In my case it was 0x77
this adress has to be set in the source code
